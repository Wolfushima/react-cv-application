# React CV Application

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Description

This is my CV application built to learn and understand the basics of React such as:

- State and Props:
  - How to pass functions, state, or other values between components as `props`
  - The purpose of `state` in a React component
  - The importance of using `setState()` instead of mutating state directly
